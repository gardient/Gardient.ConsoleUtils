I would say this was inspired by [agolaszewski's Inquierer.cs](https://github.com/agolaszewski/Inquirer.cs) but that would imply that I didn't just copy most of the code

At this point all I did was break it into different projects

Really if you want a well maintained package you should check out [their repository](https://github.com/agolaszewski/Inquirer.cs)
